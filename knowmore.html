       <h1><i>hey there coffee lovers!</i></h1><br>
       are you a fan of starbucks's world-renowed coffee?<br>
       Did you know that Starbucks has not one, not two, but THREE teams dedicated to ensuring that,<br>
        you always get a cup of some of the world's finest coffee?<br>
Let's take a closer look at these teams and what they do to guarantee a top-notch coffee experience for you!<br>

First up, we have the Farmer Support Centers (FSCs) located in various coffee-growing regions such as ,<br>
<ul>
    <li>COSTA RICA</li>
    <li>MEXICO</li>
    <li>COLOMBIA</li>
    <li>RWANDA</li>
    <li>TANZANIA</li>
    <li>ETHIOPIA</li>
    <li>SUMATRA</li>
    <li>YUNNAN</li>
</ul>
 These center provide support to farmers and suppliers with the help of agronomists,quality experts,and C.A.F.E.Practices administrators.<br>
 This team's focus is to ensure that the coffee beans are grown sustainably and responsibly, <br>
 so you can enjoy your cup of coffee guilt-free!<br>

Next, we have the Starbucks Coffee Trading Company (SCTC), located in Lausanne, Switzerland.<br>
 This team is responsible for global coffee purchasing and works with suppliers to manage all of Starbucks green coffee purchases. <br>
 They manage all the farmer <br>
 business relationships<br> negotiate contracts<br> and ensure that the coffee beans meet Starbucks' high-quality standards.<br>

Finally, we have the Global Coffee Quality (GCQ) team based in Seattle, Washington.<br>
 This team ensures that coffee quality is maintained from the roasting plant to the customers.<br>
  They manage product development, define quality standards, and determine global business needs. <br>
  The GCQ team also 
  <ul>
<li>forecasts future green coffee needs</li>
<li>manages the aging and decaffeination processes</li>
<li>creates and maintains the recipes for Starbucks' blends</li>
<li>communicates green coffee needs to the SCTC.</li>
</ul>
Did you know that between the SCTC and GCQ tasting rooms,<br>
 each taster cups more than 250,000 cups of coffee each year? <br>
 That's a lot of coffee! And, each coffee that Starbucks purchases has been tasted in 15 cups. <br>
 If any of those cups are in question due to defects or cup quality, <br>
 the coffee will get cupped up to an additional 36 times to ensure quality in the purchase. <br>
 That's some serious dedication to quality!

So, the next time you take a sip of your Starbucks coffee, <br>
know that it's the result of the hard work and dedication of these three teams.<br>
 <b>Cheers to a great cup of coffee!</b>
