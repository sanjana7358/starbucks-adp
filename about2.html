       <h1>About Us</h1><br>
It happens millions of times each week, <br>a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista ,but each interaction is unique.<br>
It is just a moment in time, just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.<br>

<i>But it is a connection....</i><br>

We make sure everything we do honors that connection from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world,<br>
 to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.<br>

From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we have been, <br>
every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.
